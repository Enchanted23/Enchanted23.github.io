          </b>
              <br>Question Classification Model is quite an important part of Jia Jia. A chat robot need to grasp the speaker's intention and decide to change this intention to real action sometimes merely from his short question.<br>I mainly work with the people in the NLP subgroup inside the Jia Jia group. With the help of them, I did a lot of research in the field of text classification and applied these algorithms to the Question Classification Model of Jia Jia. From Naive Bayes to SVM, then to deep learning model like CNN and RNN, I found the most suitable and practical method and used it to enhance the classification model. <br><br>
