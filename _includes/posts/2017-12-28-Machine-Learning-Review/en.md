> Yesterday, I decided to review what I had learnt about Machine learning at college, enhancing my knowledge of the fied and preparing for some interviews.

*I will begin with reviewing some of the books I have read. Then I will go deeper into some problems in specific projects or tasks.*

## Machine Learning (Watermelon Book)

### 1. Model Evaluation and Selection

**overfitting:**  

An overfitted model is a statistical model that ==contains more parameters than can be justified by the data==.

 In statistics, overfitting is "the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably".
