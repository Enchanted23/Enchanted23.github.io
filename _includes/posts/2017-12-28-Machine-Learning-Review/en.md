> Yesterday, I decided to review what I had learnt about Machine learning at college, enhancing my knowledge of the fied and preparing for some interviews.

*I will begin with reviewing some of the books I have read. Then I will go deeper into some problems in specific projects or tasks.*

## Machine Learning (Watermelon Book)

### 1. Model Evaluation and Selection

**Overfitting:**  An overfitted model is a statistical model that **contains more parameters than can be justified by the data**. In statistics, overfitting is "the production of an analysis that corresponds too closely or exactly to a particular set of data, and may therefore fail to fit additional data or predict future observations reliably".

**Underfitting:** It occurs when a statistical model cannot adequately capture the underlying structure of the data. Underfitted model is a model where **some parameters or terms that would appear in a correctly specified model are missing**.

**Testing:**

1. **hold-out**

   $$ D=S\cup T, S\cap T=\varnothing $$

2. **cross validation**

    

3. **bootstrapping**
