*This blog is a brief introduction and analysis of the* **situated intelligent interactive systems**, *the adimrable work of* **[Professor Yu](http://www.cs.cmu.edu/~zhouyu/)**.

>  These systems can coordinate with users to achieve effective and natural interactions.

*At the beginning of Professor Yu's Research Statement, she said the following sentences.*

> Communication is an intricate dance, an ensemble of coordinated individual actions. Imagine a future where machines interact with us like humans, waking us up in the morning, navigating us to work, or discussing our daily schedules in a coordinated and natural manner.

*What a wonderful world these words depicted. Let's take a closer look at the embryo of the next generation interactive systems.*

## Introduction

```
Situation Intelligence Framework
The framework has three key components: situation awareness, actions to coordinate the situation, and a statistical planning policy to select among actions to achieve coordinated long-term interaction.

Situation Awareness for Coordination
Conversation Strategies for Understanding and Adaptation
Statistical Policies for Long-term Interaction Planning

Applications in Conversation Systems
