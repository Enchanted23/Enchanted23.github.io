> **This blog is a brief analysis of the outstanding paper Zero-Shot Activity Recognition with Verb Attribute Induction**

## Introduction of the paper

> Experimental results confirm that action attributes inferred from language can provide a predictive signal for zero-shot prediction of previously unseen activities.

*Our goal is twofold.*

**A: we seek to use use distributed word embeddings in tandem with dictionary definitions to obtain a high level understanding of verbs.**

**B: we seek to use these predicted attributes to allow a classifier to recognize a broader set of activities than what was seen in training time.**
